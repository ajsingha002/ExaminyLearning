As a recent B.Tech graduate in Computer Science and Engineering who has
been working with National Stock Exchange of India as a Java developer for
last 5 months, I would like to enquire about the Software Development
Engineer I position open in Bangalore.
I have a very clear understanding of Software development Workflow and my
skills majorly lie in JSP Servlet Technology, Node.js, and other such web
technologies. I also have hands-on experience in working with Linux platform.
Understanding that as a recent graduate, I have a lot to learn, I would like to
assert that I am a fast learner and quick to grasp new technologies and skill
set. I have been recognized for my high level of motivation and my strong
communication skills. I am able to adapt my communication style to reflect the
needs of any audience.
I believe the opportunity to work in different environments and with
different technologies in your organization will help me develop skills that can
fulfill your client needs.
